Welcome to my personal page. I am an economist specialized in applied econometrics and research. Currently, I work as an assistant professor of Mathematical Economics, Market Research, Economics, and Microeconomics at the National University of [San Crist√≥bal de Huamanga - UNSCH](https://facultades.unsch.edu.pe/new_facea/). My experience includes providing consultancy in scientific research and processing different databases. Additionally, I have skills in handling programs such as STATA, R, Python, and Matlab, which I use to conduct detailed and accurate analysis.

In my role as a professor, I focus on conveying my knowledge in a clear and concise manner, always seeking to foster interest and active participation from my students. Likewise, I strive to stay updated on the latest trends and advancements in the field of economics, in order to provide quality and relevant education for today's world.

As a researcher, I have participated in various projects addressing topics of great importance for economic and social development. My focus is on the practical application of economic theory to generate concrete solutions to the challenges facing our society. In addition to my academic work, I also offer consultancy services in [Research](https://sirberha.github.io/HasbLab/) and data analysis for companies and institutions requiring a rigorous and professional approach to decision-making.
